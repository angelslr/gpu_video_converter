# gpu_video_converter

A simple script that converts videos using NVIDIA GPU acceleration while preserving metadata (such as modification date).

This is useful when you have several videos, and you want to keep the capture date.

It is advisable to try a video first

## Use
- Put the script into a folder with videos to convert.
- Execute on a terminal with "./gpu_video_converter".
- Enter the input and output format.
- Enter bitrate of video.
- Enter output path (it must be different to avoid conflicts).

The script will convert all the videos in that folder with the entered data.
